# AirBnB clone - RESTful API
Rest API is a software architectural style for Backend.

Rest = “REpresentational State Transfer”. API = Application Programming Interface

Its purpose is to induce performance, scalability, simplicity, modifiability, visibility, portability, and reliability.

Rest API is Resource-based, a resource is an object and can be access by a URI. An object is “displayed”/transferred via a representation (typically JSON). HTTP methods will be actions on a resource.

Example:

Resource: Person (John)
Service: contact information (GET)
Representation:
first_name, last_name, date_of_birth
JSON format
